# WebDev-Projects-Portfolio-
Portfolio- Internship Projects(TASK 2)
This Portfolio Website project showcases my skills, projects, and contact information in a single responsive web page â€” an essential project for any aspiring web developer.

In this project, I implemented:

1. A clean HTML structure to organize personal sections like About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact

2. Styling using CSS to create a modern layout with proper spacing, font styles, and responsive design elements

3. Basic interactivity using links and buttons to allow users to navigate or download my resume

4. Integration of GitHub and email links to make the site functional as a real-world personal portfolio

This project helped me understand the importance of UI/UX in presenting information and the value of having an online presence as a developer.
